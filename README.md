## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Newtoneiro/Object_Detection_Frontend.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Object_Detection_Frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**

   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click "Add project," enter a name, and follow the on-screen instructions.

2. **Enable Authentication:**

   - In the left sidebar, click on "Authentication."
   - Go to the "Sign-in method" tab and enable the sign-in providers you need (e.g., Email/Password, Google).

3. **Set Up Google Sign-In:**

   - If you've enabled Google as a sign-in provider, go to the "Sign-in method" tab.
   - Click on the Google sign-in provider and enable it.
   - In the same tab, find the "Web client ID" â€“ this is your `CLIENT_ID`.

4. **Obtain `google-services.json` for Android:**

   - Navigate to your Firebase project's settings.
   - Click on the Android icon in the "Your apps" section.
   - Register your app with the package name (from `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`).
   - Download `google-services.json` and place it in the main directory.

5. **Obtain `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS:**

   - In Firebase Console, click on the iOS icon in the "Your apps" section.
   - Register your app with the bundle ID (from `ios/YourProjectName.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`).
   - Download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and place it in the main directory.

6. **Update `.env` File:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add the following variables:

     ```env
     WEB_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_CLIENT_ID
     SERVER_API_ADDRESS=YOUR_SERVER_API_ADDRESS
     SERVER_API_PORT=YOUR_SERVER_API_PORT
     ```

## Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

This will start the Expo development server. You can then open the app on your device or emulator by following the instructions in the Expo CLI.

## Running Unit Tests

You can run unit tests using Jest with the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
